Plotting values from data that is in different txt files
---


Run ploting_tempeparture_curves.R to create graphics on the plot directory.
To change different temperatues you have to modify the following variable (TEMP <- "1220")
and run the R script again that creates a png file having the name of the temperature.


TODO.
* Add descriptions
* Create a second version to automatise the plot creation for each temparature
* Create a better plot using more functions from the xyplot


Enjoy :-)
