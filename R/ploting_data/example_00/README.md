Plotting values from data from different txt files in different paths
---

1. Generate artificial data  
data path contains a create_artificial_data.R script
for that purpose.

2. Read data, plot it and save plots  
Run ploting_tempeparture_curves.R to create graphics on the plot directory.
To change different temperatues you have to modify the following variable (TEMPVAL <- "201")
and run the R script again that creates a png file having the name of the temperature.


TODO.
* Add descriptions for the code
* Create a second version to automatise the plot creation for each temparature
* Create a better plot using more functions from the xyplot


Enjoy :-)
